# introduction
hello, this is my 2D gravity and space simulator. written in python and pyray

# controlls
[tab] switch modes settings, drawing, deleting, orbits and statistics <br>
[up][down] select a setting <br>
[left][right] change the selected setting <br>
[mouse left]+[drag] pan around <br>
[mouse scroll] zoom in and out

# settings
here you can change the basic simulation rules
<ul>
  <li> walls: turn on and off the worlds boundries </li>
  <li> walls x, walls y: change the width and height of the boundries </li>
  <li> merge: turn on and off the planets merging on collision to form a new one</li>
  <li> bounce: turn on and off wether planets bounce or stick on collision </li>
  <li> gravity: change the effect of gravity between bodies</li>
